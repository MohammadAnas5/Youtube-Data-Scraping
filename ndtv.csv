Kashmir has a number of water bodies including Dal Lake where a large number of migratory birds come and spend time. But these migratory birds face a lot of problems like the shortage of food during the winter season. So to feed these migratory birds, a bird lover named Mohamad Yasin took an idea from abroad to set up a bird forest resort where birds can get food. Earlier, Yasin worked as a tour operator in Delhi and Rajasthan and spent most of his time there to earn his livelihood. For the last few years, he visited many foreign countries including Thailand, Indonesia, Switzerland, Ukraine and saw different species of birds and people feeding them at particular spots regularly. He got inspired from this and decided to set up a unique bird resort where he can live in a houseboat and feed the birds. A good number of migratory birds came in a large portion of marshland where Yasin feeds them 2 or 3 times a day. He also selected some particular spots that he visits every day on his Shikara boat to feed them properly.', '', 'Watch Latest News: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...', '', 'About NDTV (English news channel): ', ' ', ""NDTV is India's Most-Trusted News Broadcaster with the latest updates in news, sports, entertainment and much more from within India and around the world.
